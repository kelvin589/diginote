## Overview
The aim of this project was to develop a prototype of an electronic Post-It note system which a member of staff (specifically, university lecturers) can display via a mobile device placed on the door to their office. 

Using a remote mobile dashboard, it allows a staff member to leave notices as to his/her office presence and associated availability, to post real-time messages for people who are expected at their office, etc. 

Its core purpose was to ensure that availability is communicated clearly and easily under different contexts of use to planned and prospective visitors to the individualsâ€™ office.
